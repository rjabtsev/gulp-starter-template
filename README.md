# Gulp Starter Template
My Gulp starter template with BrowserSync, SCSS compiler, CSS and JS minifiers and image optimizer.

## How to use it?
### 1. Installation
`npm install` - Download or clone it and run this command to install all dependencies.

### 2. Commands
`gulp` - Starts the server, watches for changes to files, compiles SCSS to CSS files and minifies them along with JS files.

`gulp build` - Optimizes images and creates a new build, also removes the old build if there is any.
